Final Grading Rubric
Course: IS 590r --AI Applications in Business Total Points: 200 (weighted across three grading domains) Philosophy: We grade your PROCESS, not your product. A team with a simpler app and a strong, documented process will outscore a team with a polished product and no evidence of how they built it.

What Changed from Midterm
Midterm Allowance Final Expectation
No penalty for missing code/implementation Working demo required — in person. Code must exist and run.
Friends-and-family interviews accepted Must include interviews outside your immediate social circle — target users, strangers, or domain contacts. Friends-and-family can supplement but cannot be the only source.
Falsification tests designed but unexecuted Falsification tests must be executed with documented results.
Empty changelogs, stale docs not penalized Documents must be living artifacts — current context.md, updated roadmaps, PRD that reflects the actual project. If you pivoted, the version history should show the evolution.
Logging library present but unused in app Structured logging must be integrated into the actual application, not just defined in a standalone file.
15-minute presentations, no demo required 20-minute presentations with in-person working demo and process narrative.
Midterm was a first look — introduce your idea Final is a continuation, not a repeat. Don't re-present your midterm. Start from where midterm left off and show what changed, deepened, or pivoted.
MCP scored as a sub-criterion MCP is no longer a scored criterion. MCP configs often contain secrets and should be gitignored. We care that you used MCP, not that the config is committed.
CLAUDE.md / .cursorrules not explicitly required CLAUDE.md or .cursorrules with behavioral guidance is now an explicit sub-criterion in AI Development Infrastructure.
Some teams gitignored their ai/ folder Do NOT gitignore your ai/, aiDocs/, or planning folders. Graders must be able to see your roadmaps, plans, changelogs, and context.md. These are graded artifacts. Only gitignore secrets and library folders (.env, .testEnvVars, MCP configs, node_modules/, venv/).
mvp.md not consistently graded at midterm mvp.md is a required deliverable for the final. It defines the concrete, scope-constrained version of what you are actually building. The PRD can include broader vision and future features, but mvp.md is the anchor for what you are delivering now.
No peer evaluation Confidential peer evaluation form is a required deliverable (see separate form). Peer evaluations do not directly change scores but may be used to adjust individual grades if significant contribution imbalances are identified.
Important: Everything that was expected at midterm is still expected. These are additions, not replacements.

Grading Philosophy: Process Adherence as a Lens
Process adherence is not a separate grading area -- it is the lens through which ALL areas are evaluated. Students are expected to demonstrate that they followed the processes taught in class: document-driven development, AI-augmented workflows, systematic iteration, and structured debugging. This is assessed within each technical and product area, not scored as its own category. Course material is required process, not optional suggestions.

Who Grades What
Grader Focus Weight Areas Scoring
Jason Product & system design 45% 5 areas, each scored out of 20 points (100 raw total) Weighted to 90 of 200 final points
Casey Technical process 45% 4 areas, each scored out of 25 points (100 raw total) Weighted to 90 of 200 final points
Guest Grader Presentation quality 10% 4 sub-criteria, each scored out of 25 points (100 raw total) Weighted to 20 of 200 final points
Jason's Product & System Design (45% of Final Grade)
Each area is scored out of 20 points. Total: 100 raw points, weighted to 90 of 200 final points.

At midterm, we graded whether you had these artifacts — a system diagram, a problem statement, a customer definition, success criteria, evidence of customer conversations. At final, we grade what happened when those artifacts met reality. Every area below asks the same fundamental question: how did this evolve through building, testing, and engaging with real customers? If your final presentation sounds identical to your midterm, you haven't demonstrated growth.

1. System Understanding (20 points)
   At midterm you showed us a system diagram. At final we want to see how building your product changed your understanding of the system.

Show us what you got wrong — or what you didn't see — at midterm. What new elements, relationships, or feedback loops did you discover by actually operating in this system? Which leverage points did you try to pull, and what happened? Your diagram should look different from midterm because your understanding is different. If it hasn't changed, either you got it perfectly right the first time (show us evidence) or you haven't been paying attention.

2. Problem Identification (20 points)
   At midterm you identified a problem. At final we want to see how that problem was tested, refined, and sharpened through real-world experience.

Did your falsification tests confirm you were right, or did they reveal something unexpected? Show us the results and what they meant. If you pivoted, walk us through the evidence that made you change course. If you stayed the course, show us the evidence that validated your original hypothesis — not just "we still believe it" but "here's what we learned that proved it." Your problem statement should be more precise and grounded than it was at midterm.

3. Customer Focus (20 points)
   At midterm you identified a target customer. At final we want to see how your understanding of that customer deepened through real research and engagement.

You should know your customer better now than you did at midterm — and you should be able to explain specifically what changed. Did you talk to people beyond your friends and family — actual target users, domain experts, strangers? Has your competitive analysis evolved based on what you learned while building? Your solution positioning should reflect what customers actually told you, not what you assumed they would say.

4. Success & Failure Planning (20 points)
   At midterm you defined what success and failure would look like. At final we want to see whether you actually measured against those criteria and what you found.

Did you test your own success/failure indicators? Where do you actually stand against the metrics you set for yourselves? If you couldn't measure what you planned to measure, what did that teach you about measurement itself? Your pivot plans should no longer be hypothetical — they should be informed by real data.

5. Customer Interaction (20 points)
   At midterm you showed us that you talked to customers. At final we want to see that those conversations actually shaped what you built.

Point to specific features, design decisions, or pivots that exist because of customer feedback. Show us the feedback loop: you engaged, you learned something, you changed something, and you went back to validate. Interviews must extend beyond friends and family. The question isn't whether you talked to people — it's whether talking to people made your solution better, and whether you can prove it.

Casey's Technical Process (45% of Final Grade)
Each area is scored out of 25 points. Total: 100 raw points, weighted to 90 of 200 final points.

# Area Points What "Good" Looks Like

1 PRD & Document-Driven Development 25 PRD is clear enough to build from and serves as the product anchor (can include broader vision and future features). A separate mvp.md defines the concrete, scope-constrained deliverable. If you pivoted, the PRD should have evolved (with version history); if you stayed the course, it should be stable. Development follows the PRD -> mvp.md -> plan -> roadmap -> implementation pipeline. Documents are living artifacts that reflect the current project state. Evidence of AI-assisted iteration, not one-shot generation.
2 AI Development Infrastructure 25 AI folder pattern properly implemented (context.md, project docs). Context.md uses the bookshelf pattern (references key docs with 1-2 sentence descriptions so a new AI session can orient immediately) and is current. CLAUDE.md or .cursorrules provides behavioral guidance. Git workflow shows branching, meaningful commits, and PRs. ai/ folder committed to repo (graders need to see roadmaps, plans, changelogs). .gitignore covers secrets and library folders: .env, .testEnvVars, MCP configs (which may contain API keys), node_modules/, venv/, etc. No secrets committed.
3 Phase-by-Phase Implementation & Working Demo 25 Code was built incrementally following roadmap phases -- not one-shot prompted. Roadmaps used as checklists during implementation with tasks checked off. Evidence of multi-session workflow (plan/implement/review). Git history shows iterative, incremental progress across the semester. In-person working demo demonstrating core functionality.
4 Structured Logging & Debugging 25 Structured logging implemented and integrated into application code — not just a standalone logger file. CLI test scripts exist and work. Test-log-fix loop followed -- evidence that AI read logs, diagnosed issues, and fixed them. Debugging process is documented or evidenced in git history.
Guest Grader (10% of Final Grade)
The guest grader evaluates presentation quality using 4 sub-criteria, each scored out of 25 points (100 raw total), weighted to 20 of 200 final points.

# Sub-Criterion Points What "Good" Looks Like

1 Communication Quality 25 Presentation is clear, confident, and well-delivered. All team members speak competently. Q&A responses are thoughtful.
2 Storytelling & Journey 25 Team tells a compelling story about their project journey. Demonstrates honest self-awareness about challenges and what they would do differently. A pivot story and a refinement story are equally compelling — what matters is growth from midterm, not a repeat.
3 Visual Design & Demo 25 Slides and visual materials support the narrative. Demo is well-integrated into the presentation, not tacked on at the end. Product shown throughout.
4 Overall Impact 25 Presentation leaves a positive, professional impression. A listener can explain what the team built, why they built it, and what they learned.
Scoring Scale
For each area, we use a four-level scale recalibrated so that solid work earns an A-minus:

Level What It Means Score Range
Exemplary Exceptional work that goes beyond expectations. Could be shown to future students as an example. 95-100% of area points
Proficient Solid work, process clearly followed. Meets all expectations. 90-94% of area points
Developing Partial implementation, some gaps in process or understanding. 80-89% of area points
Insufficient Major gaps, process not followed, or work not submitted. Below 80% of area points
Grade Scale
Grade Minimum Percentage Minimum Points (/200)
A 93% 186
A- 90% 180
B+ 87% 174
B 83% 166
B- 80% 160
C+ 77% 154
C 73% 146
Worked Scoring Example
Suppose a team receives the following raw scores from each grader:

Grader Raw Score (out of 100) Weight Weighted Points
Jason (Product & System Design) 85/100 45% 85 x 0.90 = 76.5
Casey (Technical Process) 90/100 45% 90 x 0.90 = 81.0
Guest Grader (Presentation) 92/100 10% 92 x 0.20 = 18.4
Total 175.9 / 200
175.9 / 200 = 87.95% → B+

The multiplier for each domain: Jason and Casey's raw scores are multiplied by 0.90 (to map 100 raw → 90 weighted). The Guest Grader's raw score is multiplied by 0.20 (to map 100 raw → 20 weighted).

Presentation Format
Duration: 20 minutes per team. This is tight — prioritize and rehearse. Not every required element needs deep coverage; focus your time on the areas where your team's story is strongest. But every element should be addressed.
Schedule: Presentations across April 8, 13, and 15.
Submission deadline: Monday April 7 at 23:59. All project code, documentation, and presentation materials must be committed and pushed by this deadline, regardless of which day you present. No exceptions, no late submissions. Work pushed after this deadline will not be graded.
All team members must contribute and be able to explain their individual contributions
Required elements:
System design diagram
Process narrative: how you planned, built, iterated, and adapted
In-person working demo — plan to demo live. A scrappy backup recording is smart to have in case something breaks on demo day — you won't be penalized for falling back to a recording if your live demo fails unexpectedly. However, if you know in advance that a live demo won't be possible, contact Casey or Jason before your presentation to arrange an exception.
Show the product throughout the presentation, not just at the end
Honest discussion of what you learned, what surprised you, and what you would do differently
Q&A: Thoughtful responses expected, demonstrating understanding of trade-offs and honest discussion of limitations
Framing: This is your completed project story. Show us the full journey — the plan, the pivots, the process, and the result.
Peer evaluation: Each team member submits a confidential peer evaluation form (see separate form)
Structuring Your Presentation: Pivot vs. Refinement
Do not re-present your midterm. Your team took one of two paths — structure accordingly:

If your team pivoted to a new idea:

Open with the pivot story — what evidence triggered the change and how you evaluated the new direction
Show customer validation of the new idea (not just "we think this is better")
Demo the new product — how it works, who it serves
Connect the pivot to your falsification results and customer feedback — evidence-driven pivots are a success, not a failure
Show updated system diagram, problem statement, and success/failure criteria for the new direction
If your team stayed the course and refined:

Start from where midterm left off — don't re-introduce your idea
Show us the depth that only comes from sustained execution — refinement produces insight that a pivot team never gets to reach
Lead with what deepened: more customer feedback (beyond friends and family), refined problem understanding, validated or invalidated assumptions
Show evolution in your system diagram, problem statement, and competitive analysis
Demo should show meaningful progress — more functional, more tested, more informed by real feedback
Show the iteration loop: engage → learn → change → re-engage
Either path is equally valid. We grade the quality of your process and the depth of your learning, not whether you pivoted.

What We're NOT Grading
A finished, polished product. A working prototype is great; a production-ready app is not expected.
Paying customers, revenue, or a business model. We are not grading your revenue model or business plan. We DO expect evidence of customer research and engagement -- interviews, feedback sessions, prototype testing with real people. For the final, you must include interviews with people outside your immediate social circle — people who do not have a built-in bias toward your product. Friends and family can supplement your research, but your primary customer evidence should come from target users, domain contacts, or strangers.
Which AI tool you used. Claude Code, Cursor, ChatGPT -- we care about the process, not the brand.
Complexity of the idea. A simple idea executed with strong process beats an ambitious idea with no evidence of how it was built.
Perfect code. We want to see the journey: plans, attempts, failures, fixes, iteration.
Unlimited AI access. If you're on a free tier, efficient use of limited resources is itself a positive signal.
MCP configuration files in the repo. MCP configs often contain secrets and should be gitignored. We care that you used MCP in your workflow, not that the config is committed.
Quick Evidence Checklist
Use this to self-assess before your presentation. You do not need every single item, but the more you can demonstrate, the stronger your grade.

Jason's Product & System Design Domain
The through-line: at midterm you had these things. At final, show us how they changed through building.

System Understanding:

[ ] System diagram has evolved since midterm — not just cosmetic changes
[ ] Team can articulate what they learned about the system through building
[ ] Leverage points validated through experience, not just hypothesized
Problem Identification:

[ ] Problem statement has matured — refined or pivoted based on evidence
[ ] Falsification tests executed with documented results that influenced understanding
[ ] If pivoted: evolution justified; if stayed: evidence-based rationale for why
Customer Focus:

[ ] Customer understanding deepened through research beyond friends and family
[ ] Competitive analysis updated based on building experience
[ ] Solution positioning reflects validated understanding, not initial assumptions
Success & Failure Planning:

[ ] Success/failure criteria tested against reality — team can report where they stand
[ ] Pivot plans informed by real data, not midterm hypotheticals
Customer Interaction:

[ ] Interaction continued beyond midterm with clear feedback loop (engage → learn → change → re-engage)
[ ] Specific features or decisions directly shaped by customer feedback
[ ] Awareness of driving vs. being driven by the customer
Casey's Technical Domain
PRD & Document-Driven Development:

[ ] PRD exists and is comprehensive enough to build from (broader vision is fine)

A Note on Iteration, Pivoting, and Failure
This course values learning through doing. If your team pivoted your project idea, encountered a major setback, or realized your original plan was wrong -- that is not a problem. It is evidence of good process. Show us the pivot. Explain what you learned. That story is often more compelling than a smooth path from start to finish.

That said, a team that stayed the course and executed well on their original plan is not penalized for not pivoting. We are not grading whether you pivoted — we are grading the quality of your process regardless of which path you took.
