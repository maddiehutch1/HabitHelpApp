## Extra — Structured Logging
*Feb 21, 2026 · Not connected to a roadmap phase — agentic testing infrastructure*

- Added `logging: ^1.2.0` to `dependencies`
- Created `lib/services/app_logger.dart` — named loggers (`App`, `CardRepository`, `ScheduleRepository`, `NotificationService`) with a `setupLogging()` listener that prints `[LEVEL] LoggerName: message` to stdout for CLI/agent readability
- `lib/main.dart` calls `setupLogging()` before `runApp()`
- `lib/app.dart` logs cold-launch onboarding state (`hasCompletedOnboarding`) and any prefs read failure
- `lib/data/repositories/card_repository.dart` logs every CRUD operation: `insertCard`, `deleteCard`, `archiveCard`, `restoreCard`, `deferCard`, and `getCardsNeedingArchivePrompt` candidate detection
- `lib/services/notification_service.dart` logs init, permission request results, and `rescheduleAll` outcome
- All 64 unit + widget tests pass after changes; `flutter analyze` clean

- `lib/app.dart` created — bare `MaterialApp` shell, no routes yet
- 5 MVP packages added: `shared_preferences 2.5.4`, `sqflite 2.4.2`, `path 1.9.1`, `wakelock_plus 1.4.0`, `flutter_riverpod 3.2.1`
- `lib/` folder structure scaffolded per architecture doc (`data/`, `providers/`, `screens/` subtree); empty dirs tracked with `.gitkeep`
- `.gitignore` updated to include `.metadata`
- `flutter analyze` returns no issues
- **Feb 21, 2026:** `flutter run` confirmed working on Android emulator — blank app launches without crashes (M0.5 complete)

## Phase 1 — MVP Demo (code complete)
*Feb 21, 2026 · Plan: [ai/roadmaps/complete/2026-02-19-phase-1-mvp-demo.md](roadmaps/complete/2026-02-19-phase-1-mvp-demo.md)*

- `lib/screens/onboarding/onboarding_goal_screen.dart` — goal input; [Next →] disabled until text entered
- `lib/screens/onboarding/onboarding_action_screen.dart` — action input; goal shown as muted context; [Let's go →] disabled until text entered
- `lib/screens/onboarding/onboarding_confirm_screen.dart` — confirms action; [Start now] → Timer; [Save for later] → Deck; sets `hasCompletedOnboarding = true`
- `lib/screens/timer/timer_screen.dart` — countdown `MM:SS`; pulsing dot; wakelock; `AppLifecycleState` pause; `PopScope` back-block while running; haptic + "That's it." on completion

- `lib/data/repositories/card_repository.dart` — added `getAllArchivedCards`, `archiveCard`, `restoreCard`, `deferCard`, `getDeferralCount`, `getCardsNeedingArchivePrompt`, `getActiveCardCount`; `getAllCards` now filters `isArchived = 0`

- `flutter analyze` — no issues
- ⚠️ **Platform setup required before M3.7/M3.8 device test:** (1) Create `com.microdeck.pro` one-time purchase product in App Store Connect + Google Play Console; (2) Add a white-on-transparent notification icon to `android/app/src/main/res/drawable/`

## Extra — Scope Adjustment & IAP Removal
*Feb 23, 2026*

- Freemium / IAP layer removed from v1 — monetization deferred to Phase 4 (evidence-first)

- `lib/services/ai_service.dart` — added `suggestTasksFromTranscription(String transcription)`: calls OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini`, extracts up to 3 task titles from a voice note, 8 s timeout, returns empty list on any error/no-consent
- `lib/screens/create_card/voice_ai_suggestions_screen.dart` (new) — full screen; shows 1–3 checkable, inline-editable suggestion tiles; [Add selected] + "Add manually instead" fallback; `_processNextTask()` drives multi-card queue via `onCardSaved` callback
- `lib/screens/create_card/create_card_goal_screen.dart` — added optional `onCardSaved: VoidCallback?`; threaded through to `CreateCardActionScreen`
- `lib/screens/create_card/create_card_action_screen.dart` — added optional `onCardSaved`; threaded through to `CreateCardConfirmScreen`

- `lib/screens/deck/deck_screen.dart` — `_openVoiceInput()` now checks AI consent, shows `_VoiceProcessingDialog` while parsing, routes to `VoiceAISuggestionsScreen` (route name `/voiceSuggestions`) on success, falls back to `CreateCardGoalScreen(prefilledGoal:)` on empty result or no consent; added `_VoiceProcessingDialog` widget
- `integration_test/app_test.dart` — added "Voice AI suggestions — regression" group: FAB still shows voice/type options; "Type it" still reaches goal screen
- `flutter analyze` — no issues

- `lib/screens/settings/settings_screen.dart` (new) — Fresh Start mode toggle; gear icon in deck header navigates here
- `lib/screens/past_days/past_days_screen.dart` (new) — archived cards grouped by date ("Yesterday" / `Mar 26`); long-press → "Move to today" restores card to active deck
- `lib/services/voice_service.dart` (new) — `startListening()` / `stopListening()` wrapper over `speech_to_text`; handles microphone permission request
- `lib/screens/deck/widgets/voice_input_sheet.dart` (new) — 30-second recording bottom sheet; live transcription; [Discard] / [Create cards from this]
- `lib/screens/timer/timer_screen.dart` — completion shows [Done] / [Keep going]; `_extraTimeSeconds` tracked; `_storeSession()` writes to `sessions` table

- `lib/data/models/session_model.dart` (new) — `SessionModel` with `toMap` / `fromMap`
- `lib/screens/deck/deck_screen.dart` — `WidgetsBindingObserver` + `_checkDailyRollover()` archives active cards when date changes (Fresh Start mode only); `lastOpenDate` pref maintained

- `lib/screens/onboarding/` → renamed to `lib/screens/create_card/`; classes renamed `CreateCardGoalScreen`, `CreateCardActionScreen`, `CreateCardConfirmScreen`
- Language updated across all three screens (goal: "What feels big and difficult right now?"; action: "What's one tiny step you could take first?"; confirm: "Ready for your tiny start?")
- `lib/screens/deck/deck_screen.dart` — + FAB opens `_AddMethodSheet` (voice / type it); template browser + add sheets removed; `_openVoiceInput()` routes transcription to `CreateCardGoalScreen(prefilledGoal:)`; `CreateCardGoalScreen` accepts optional `prefilledGoal`
- `lib/services/ai_service.dart` (new) — OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini` integration; `generateFirstSteps()`, `makeSmaller()`, `requestConsent()` (first-time dialog + `aiSuggestionsEnabled` pref)
- `lib/screens/create_card/create_card_action_screen.dart` — "I'm stuck – show ideas" button (2–3 AI chips); "Make this smaller" button (1 smaller chip); both respect consent gate
- `lib/screens/settings/settings_screen.dart` — AI Suggestions toggle added
- `lib/data/templates.dart` — deleted (no longer referenced)
- `test/unit/templates_test.dart` — deleted (tested deleted file)
- `pubspec.yaml` — added `http: ^1.2.0`; `.env.json` stores `OPENAI_API_KEY` (gitignored)

*Feb 23, 2026*

- `assets/app_icon.png` (new) — custom 1024×1024 app icon (black background, white cards/checkmark graphic)
- `pubspec.yaml` — added `flutter_launcher_icons 0.14.4` dev dependency; registered `assets/` folder; configured `adaptive_icon_background: #000000` so Android never shows a white ring behind the icon
- Ran `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons` — generated all Android (legacy + adaptive) and iOS icon sizes
