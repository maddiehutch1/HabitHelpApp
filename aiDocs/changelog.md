## Extra — Structured Logging
*Feb 21, 2026 · Not connected to a roadmap phase — agentic testing infrastructure*

- Added `logging: ^1.2.0` to `dependencies`
- Created `lib/services/app_logger.dart` — named loggers (`App`, `CardRepository`, `ScheduleRepository`, `NotificationService`) with a `setupLogging()` listener that prints `[LEVEL] LoggerName: message` to stdout for CLI/agent readability
- `lib/main.dart` calls `setupLogging()` before `runApp()`
- `lib/app.dart` logs cold-launch onboarding state (`hasCompletedOnboarding`) and any prefs read failure
- `lib/data/repositories/card_repository.dart` logs every CRUD operation: `insertCard`, `deleteCard`, `archiveCard`, `restoreCard`, `deferCard`, and `getCardsNeedingArchivePrompt` candidate detection
- `lib/services/notification_service.dart` logs init, permission request results, and `rescheduleAll` outcome
- All 64 unit + widget tests pass after changes; `flutter analyze` clean

- `lib/screens/onboarding/onboarding_goal_screen.dart` — goal input; [Next →] disabled until text entered
- `lib/screens/onboarding/onboarding_action_screen.dart` — action input; goal shown as muted context; [Let's go →] disabled until text entered
- `lib/screens/onboarding/onboarding_confirm_screen.dart` — confirms action; [Start now] → Timer; [Save for later] → Deck; sets `hasCompletedOnboarding = true`
- `lib/screens/timer/timer_screen.dart` — countdown `MM:SS`; pulsing dot; wakelock; `AppLifecycleState` pause; `PopScope` back-block while running; haptic + "That's it." on completion

- `lib/services/ai_service.dart` — added `suggestTasksFromTranscription(String transcription)`: calls OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini`, extracts up to 3 task titles from a voice note, 8 s timeout, returns empty list on any error/no-consent
- `lib/screens/create_card/voice_ai_suggestions_screen.dart` (new) — full screen; shows 1–3 checkable, inline-editable suggestion tiles; [Add selected] + "Add manually instead" fallback; `_processNextTask()` drives multi-card queue via `onCardSaved` callback

- `lib/screens/onboarding/` → renamed to `lib/screens/create_card/`; classes renamed `CreateCardGoalScreen`, `CreateCardActionScreen`, `CreateCardConfirmScreen`
- Language updated across all three screens (goal: "What feels big and difficult right now?"; action: "What's one tiny step you could take first?"; confirm: "Ready for your tiny start?")
- `lib/screens/deck/deck_screen.dart` — + FAB opens `_AddMethodSheet` (voice / type it); template browser + add sheets removed; `_openVoiceInput()` routes transcription to `CreateCardGoalScreen(prefilledGoal:)`; `CreateCardGoalScreen` accepts optional `prefilledGoal`
- `lib/services/ai_service.dart` (new) — OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini` integration; `generateFirstSteps()`, `makeSmaller()`, `requestConsent()` (first-time dialog + `aiSuggestionsEnabled` pref)
